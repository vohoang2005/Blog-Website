# Blog-Website
~~~
Creating this Blog Website was challenging but very fun and enjoying. I Love to create dynamic pages and love to find ways to improve either
the coding, style, or design of the pages! A Short description of this project is to create a Daily Journal where you can keeps on adding daily events
onto your Blog. Every compose that you make, it will generate a new tab once you click on "Read More", as it only shows the first 100 letters as a preview.
